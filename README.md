## LR, MR, HR Thermal images

![dataset2.png](/images/dataset2.png)

1021 images captured with three different cameras. Axis Domo P1290 (LR), Axis Q2901-E (MR), and FC-6320 FLIR (HR), with a native resolution of 160x120, 320x240, and 640x512). 950 images for training, 50 for testing; the 20 remaining are not shared because of validation in PBVS-Challenge. The cameras were mounted in a rig to capture the same scene simultaneously. Download [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wuu0wkrdlcozx9z/challengedataset.rar?dl=0).

This dataset has been used in the Thermal Image Super-Resolution Challenges held in 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 during the IEEE Workshop on Perception Beyond the Visible Spectrum (PBVS).

## CrossEspectral Dataset (CIDIS)

![dataset3.png](/images/dataset3.png)

This dataset consists of 1000 pairs of images, captured using Balser and TAU2 visible and thermal spectrum cameras respectively. Worth mentioning that these two types of images come in different resolutions and spectrums, visible images with a native resolution of 1280x1024 (using a 13mm lens) and thermal images with a resolution of 640x480 (using an 8mm lens). The dataset is organized into three sets: training, validation, and testing. There are 700 image pairs for training, 200 for validation, and 100 for testing (not shared). Download [HERE](https://1drv.ms/u/s!Aq8mFtJTbzFtgc51EHSpo8DpTDrusg?e=UaDS91).

This dataset has been used in the Thermal Image Super-Resolution Challenges held in 2024 during the IEEE Workshop on Perception Beyond the Visible Spectrum (PBVS).
