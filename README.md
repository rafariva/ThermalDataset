## LR, MR, HR Thermal images

![dataset2.png](/images/dataset2.png)

1021 images capture with a three different cameras. Axis Domo P1290 (LR), Axis Q2901-E (MR) and FC-6320 FLIR (HR), with a native resolution of 160x120, 320x240 and 640x512). The cameras were mounted in a rig to capture the same scene at the same time. Download [HERE](/datasets/dataset2.rar).

This dataset has been used in the Thermal Image Super Resolution Challenges hold in 2020 and 2021 during the IEEE Workshop on Perception Beyond the Visible Spectrum (PBVS).
